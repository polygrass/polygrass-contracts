## MasterJive
MasterJive is a fork of the GooseDeFi MasterChefV2 contract (which was originally derived from Pancake's MasterChef).

## GrassToken
POT is the token which powers our yield farm. This is a pretty standard ERC20 token forked from ApeSwap's BANANA token contract.

## Timelock
Timelock is a contract used to provide enhanced security to PolyGrass' smart contract, by creating a buffer in which farm-modifying functions can be executed.

## Multicall
Boilerplate multicall contract used to optimize data fetches from the frontend.
